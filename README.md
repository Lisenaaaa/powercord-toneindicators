# powercord-toneindicators

Tells you what a tone indicator means! Run `{prefix}tone toneindicator` (e.g. `[tone gen` to see a short description of the tone indicator `/gen`)

I don't know all of them, and I mostly made this so that I could remember what some of them mean in servers where people tend to use them more.

If I'm missing some, or the descriptions are inaccurate, feel free to make a PR that changes it, and also ping me (`<@881310086411190293>`) on PC's discord with it, as I don't trust myself to check the repo that often haha
